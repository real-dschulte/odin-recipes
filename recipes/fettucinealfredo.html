        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
            <li>12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)</li>
            <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions 
                until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season 
                with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to 
                medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 
                2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to
                 a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden 
                spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a 
                simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
        </ol>
